## Housing Code Violations
Number of code enforcement calls for housing violations for each voting precinct.

### Why is this important?
The City of Lexington relies on the International Property Maintenance Code, which regulates the minimum maintenance requirements for existing buildings. The code is intended to "establish minimum maintenance standards for basic equipment, light, ventilation, heating, sanitation and fire safety," with the ultimate goal of providing for the "safe use of existing structures in the interest of the social and economic welfare of the community." High levels of housing violations may indicidate a need for rehabilitation or other assistance in an area.

Voting precincts were selected to represent neighborhoods because they cover all of Lexington, do not overlap, and more closely resemble neighborhood boundaries than census tracts or other available boundaries. They may not exactly match how people perceive the boundaries of their neighborhood, but are the most useful available geography for tracking and comparing information across Lexington.
