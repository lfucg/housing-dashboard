## Building Permits
Number of building permits for each voting precinct.

### Why is this important?
Building permits are typically the most accurate available indicator of construction in a community. This metric indicates both new construction and investment in existing strucutures. Building permits show areas where communities are growing and changing.

### About the Data
The number of all building permits issued by the Lexington Division of Building Inspection. Categories include a variety of residential, commercial, and mechanical permits.

Voting precincts were selected to represent neighborhoods because they cover all of Lexington, do not overlap, and more closely resemble neighborhood boundaries than census tracts or other boundaries.
