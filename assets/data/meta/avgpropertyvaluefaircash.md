## Residential Property Value
Average fair cash value of residential properties for each voting precinct.

### Why is this important?
Average residential property value can be a good indicator of the health of individual properties themselves in a given area. High property values often indicate a high level of maintenance, amenities, and the desirability of an area.

### About the Data
The fair cash value for residential properties in a voting precinct divided by the total number of properties in that precinct.

### Neighborhood Boundaries
Voting precincts were selected to represent neighborhoods because they cover all of Lexington, do not overlap, and more closely resemble neighborhood boundaries than census tracts or other available boundaries. They may not exactly match how people perceive the boundaries of their neighborhood, but are the most useful available geography for tracking and comparing information across Lexington.
