<p>According to the Lexington Code of Ordinances, &quot;Nuisance shall mean any condition or use of premises or of building exteriors which is detrimental to the property of others or which causes or tends to cause substantial diminution in the value of other property in the neighborhood in which such premises are located.&quot; Specifically, nuisances include the keeping of trash and debris, tall grass, vegetation in the public right-of-way, exterior storage of inoperable or unlicensed vehicles, and exterior storage of indoor furniture. A high number of nuisance calls may indicate a lack of maintenance in an area or a high number of vacant or abandoned properties.</p>

<p>Voting precincts were selected to represent neighborhoods because they cover all of Lexington, do not overlap, and more closely resemble neighborhood boundaries than census tracts or other available boundaries. They may not exactly match how people perceive the boundaries of their neighborhood, but are the most useful available geography for tracking and comparing information across Lexington. </p>
