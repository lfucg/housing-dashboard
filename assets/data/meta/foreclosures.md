## Residential Foreclosures
Number of foreclosures in each voting precinct.

### Why is this important?
A high number of foreclosures may indicate overall distress in a neighborhood. Foreclosures can create abandoned properties, which are a blight on the community and are correlated with crime.

### About the Data
The number of foreclosures for properties in each Voting Precinct as provided by the property valuation administrator.

Voting precincts were selected to represent neighborhoods because they cover all of Lexington, do not overlap, and more closely resemble neighborhood boundaries than census tracts or other boundaries.
